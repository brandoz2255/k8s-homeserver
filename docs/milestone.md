## âœ… Goal of Milestone

Create a **local `Kubernetes` development environment** with:

1. PostgreSQL running in a `StatefulSet`
2. `pgAdmin` `UI` to interact with the database
3. NGINX reverse proxy serving `pgAdmin` over **`HTTPS`** with **self-signed certificates**
4. Secure communication without requiring `DNS` for now (access via IP)
5. Future-ready for `DNS` (Pi-hole) integration
